Firstly, here is a video about quantum computing from a broad stance.

With this video, there is a whole series that goes up from qubits to quantum gates to quantum algorithms.
It is a very good series and I highly recommend using it as a guide. Feel free to branch off from these though.

Next, Here is the best video I've seen to get an introduction to quantum. It is an hour and a half, 
but its not very dense at all and is very interesting. Its from Microsoft's research arm and the
guy does a great job of teaching the subject.

Here is a video that begins talking about quantum math. It starts with a single quibit then goes onto multiple

Hope these help!
